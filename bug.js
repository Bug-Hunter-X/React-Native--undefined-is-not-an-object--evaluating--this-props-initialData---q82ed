This error occurs when you try to access a component's state or props before it has mounted.  This frequently happens within the `constructor` method or before the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method has executed.

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: this.props.initialData // Error: this.props is undefined
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
